# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Detection
This project uses a CNN model to detect and classify rice leaf diseases (Leaf Smut, Brown Spot, Bacterial Leaf Blight) with 91.67% accuracy. The dataset consists of 120 images, processed and trained using deep learning techniques. Future improvements include real-time deployment and Transfer Learning for better performance.
